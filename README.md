# KeyPlayers presents: KEYBEATS


## *"Play your keys, match the beats!"*
<br>

KeyBeats is a music memory game easy to navigate and play. The user listens to a sound sequence and then is challenged to recreate it pressing the keys in his keyboard, each one reproducing six different sounds. Success in making the sequence will bring the game to the next level: each level up will increment the sequence with one more sound!
This project has been developed to compete in the *Code Instutute Hackaton Hero Challenge*.

## The game page
The game page contains a game area with three main sections:
- The upper part shows the level the user is playing in and the score he has gained.
- The middle part contains the player, where the user can start the sound sequence. A progress bar keeps track of its duration.
- The lower part shows the different key buttons associated with six different sounds.

## Design

<br>

### Colour Palette
The colour palette is studied to give importance to the keyboard buttons, whose colors are inspired by the [Launchpad X](https://novationmusic.com/it/launch/launchpad-x). These colors are metallic and allow the keyboard to pop from the screen.

### Fonts

- Main font: 'Special Elite' - for the body and headings.
- Paired with: 'Yesteryear' - chosen to add a small style change for the footer.

<br>

## Features

The site consists of three pages, whose objective is to present the game to the user and make the playing session smooth, intuity and enjoyable.
The game is meant to be played with a keyboard and has several visual effect (shake and color of the keys, progress bar) for a better  user experience and engagement.

<br>

### Possible features to implement in future

<br>

* Add a leaderboard: 
    - Save score of every user and present it in a table.
* Play with 3 lives: 
    - Three chances to get the sequence correct, before the user loses the games and comes back to level 1.
* Introduce timing of key press for a much more engaging experience:
    - Length of keypress to determine whether user is sticking to the tempo and rhythm.
